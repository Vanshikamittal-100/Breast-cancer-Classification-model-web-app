# Breast Cancer Classification Model Web App

## Project Overview

This web application uses a breast cancer classification model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on input features. The model is built using Python's scikit-learn library and deployed using Flask.

## Features
User Input: Allows users to input breast cancer features through a web form.

Prediction: Uses a pre-trained model to predict the presence of breast cancer.

Results Display: Shows results with corresponding images and messages based on the prediction.

## Technologies Used
Flask: Web framework for Python used to build the web application.

scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for building the classification model.

HTML/CSS: Front-end technologies used to design the web interface.

Bootstrap: Framework used for styling the web application.

Python: Programming language used for both the model and web application.

## Model Information
Model Type: SVM(Support Vector Machine)
Features: Describe the features used by the model.

Data: Provide information about the dataset used for training (if applicable).

## Usage
Navigate to the web application in your browser.

Enter the breast cancer features into the input field.

Click on "Predict" to see the result.

The result will show whether you have breast cancer or not, along with corresponding images and messages.
